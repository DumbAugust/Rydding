This is a very badly organised and documented school project i had. I mostly wanted to try connecting the frontend with the backend using node.js and sql.

In the backend i have an unsecure sql database which saves profiles and connects them with other profiles to create families using a common family code. Might try to do something like this in the future however i wont improve on this project.
